# PomodoroTime
A tomato timer app based on the Pomodoro Technique created as a project to learn more Android Developmen by an amateur

I am creating this app to improve my skills regarding Android development and to provide myself with a timer
to help my time management. This timer is based off of Francesco Cirillo's "Pomodoro Technique" that begins
with a 25 minute timer (a pomodoro) followed by a 5 minute short break. After four pomodoros, a long break
of 15 minutes is given and the cycle repeats.

Find out more about the Pomodoro Technique [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).
